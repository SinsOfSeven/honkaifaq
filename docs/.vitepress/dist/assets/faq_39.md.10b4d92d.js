The main factors to consider are the following: <strong>Time fracture:</strong> In MA it may be useful to use a BD holder that has time fracture on evasion, e.g. MC and BS. <strong>Switch skills:</strong> Valkyries with no switch skill (e.g. VK, MC, BB) can be better BD holders since they won&#39;t apply JST/newt B prematurely with switch in attacks. <strong>QTE skills:</strong> QTE skills can be useful to provide time fracture and further trigger the QTE of your dps (e.g. SF). <strong>Typing:</strong> Sometimes you need a BD holder of a particular type in order to satisfy lead skills, e.g. use a psy BD holder for LE HF team and for HoT teams, or use a BD holder whose type will satisfy AE lead in applicable teams.</p>',3),n=[s];function l(d,i,c,h,p,_){return o(),t("div",null,n)}const m=e(r,[["render",l]]);export{u as __pageData,m as default};
