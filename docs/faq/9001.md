# Battlesuits: Cards, Fragments and Ranks

## Battlesuits
<!-- might replace with a battlesuit FAQ -->
A Battlesuit is a playable version of a Valkyrie, Valkyries are not limited to as single Battlesuit. It's important to distinguish between Battlesuits because they may do very different things.

To view all the Battlesuits, you can open the Valkyrie menu and scroll through the portraits. Each Battlesuit can be unlocked, and even Ranked Up beyond their base ranks all the way to `SSS`.

Valkyries can be B-Rank, A-Rank, or S-Rank when they are unlocked. They can be unlocked with Cards, or Fragments. There are two more distinctions for Battlesuits, Awakened and `SP`. 

::: info Q: "What's Awakened Battlesuit?"
A: To learn more about them and main differences you can read this [faq Awakened](/faq/41)
:::
<!-- TODO: same block with faq sp  -->

::: info Q: "What's an SP Battlesuit?"
A: SP Valkyries (SP can mean whatever you want) - These Valkyries have extra-skills, and most of their skills are available from low ranks. All SP Valks (so far) are base A rank, and are usually supports. Though many can be Damage dealers.

## Card Sources
The primary sources of Valkyrie Cards are Gachas, there are also Eggs which contain Valkyrie Cards, Fragments, or both. Some are Guarantees, while other are randomized.

## Fragment sources
There are several ways to obtain Fragments: buying them from [shops](/faq/35), farming [expeditions](/faq/5), bonuses from events, obtaining [duplicate Battlesuit Card](#duplicate-Battlesuit-Card) or rank-up Stamps. These are in addition to the Eggs mentioned above. 

If you do not own a Battlesuit, you can tap the "Get" button from the Valkyrie menu, which will have information on how to obtain her Fragments or Cards. Sometimes, this "Get" section may be empty, which means she is currently not in the gacha and not farmable.

:::tip Note:
Technically, Awakened Valkyries use *souls* insteads of Fragments, but for simplicity of this guide we're gonna call them Fragments as well.

Fragment Unlock| B Rank| A Rank| S Rank
:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:
Standard|10|30|80
Awakening|-|40|100
SP|-|40|-

Once you have enough Fragments to unlock a Valkyrie, you might consider waiting. Those Fragments might be better spent on rank-ups after you've obtained a Valkyrie Card. It's a more efficent use if the intention is to rank her up, which is the case for most farmable Valkyries and some Gacha Valkyries with farmable Stamps/Fragments. However, if you do not intend obtain a Card, it's fine to unlock with Fragments.

## Duplicate Battlesuit Card
When you obtain Card for a Battlesuit you already have unlocked - it will convert to Fragments.

| Battlesuit class | Base rank |||
| ^^ | B | A | S |
| :---: | :----: | :----: | :----: |
| Standard | 7 | 18 | 30 |
| Awakened | - | 30 | 70 |
| SP | - | 30 | - |
[Fragments for duplicate Card]

## Stamps
Stamps are another source of Fragments, each is worth 10 Fragments. Keep in mind Stamps can **only be used when the Battlesuit is Unlocked.**

## Ranking up
To increase rank (rank up), you need to collect Fragments, based on the "class" of Battlesuit - Standard, Awakened or SP. The totals are the same for all valks, but the cards save you a lot of fragments.

Evolve| B→A| A→S| S→SS| SS→SSS|Total
:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:
Standard|20|50|100|200|380
Awakening|-|100|250|600|950
SP|-|60|200|400|700

## Sub-ranks
All Valks have additional rank breakpoints.Theses are known as sub-stars/subranks or constellations. All constellations are sub-ranks, but not all subranks are constellations. It also effects how many breakpoints there are for a valk.

- Substars grant additional stat boosts.

    > Notice how you unlock a skill only after reaching SSS rank
    :::
- Constellations also grant skills or skill upgrades.

::: tip
You can use notation like this `SS.1` or `S1` with or without a period to show sub ranks.
